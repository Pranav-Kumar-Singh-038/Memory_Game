# Memory Game Project

## Introduction
Memory Game, also known as Concentration or Matching Game, is a retro grid-based card game implemented using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The objective of the game is to match pairs of cards by turning over two cards at a time. The game is inspired by the classic concept and has been designed to test and improve your memory and concentration skills.

## How to Play
1. **Getting Started:** Open the Memory Game in your web browser to begin the game. You will see a grid of facedown cards.

2. **Gameplay:** To play, click on any facedown card to flip it over. This will reveal the hidden symbol on the card.

3. **Matching Cards:** Try to find another card on the grid with the same symbol as the one you just flipped. Click on another facedown card to reveal its symbol.

4. **Matching Pairs:** If the symbols on the two flipped cards match, a pop-up alert will notify you of the successful match. The matched cards will then disappear from the grid.

5. **Scoring:** For each successful match, your score will increase by one point.

6. **Mismatching Cards:** If the two flipped cards do not match, a pop-up alert will notify you of this. The cards will then flip back to their facedown position.

7. **Continuation:** Continue flipping pairs of cards until you successfully match all the cards on the board.

8. **Winning the Game:** The game ends when all the cards have been successfully matched and removed from the grid. A celebratory message will appear, congratulating you on your victory.

9. **Restarting the Game:** At any point during the game, you can choose to restart the game by clicking on the "Restart" button. This will shuffle the cards and reset your score.

## Mark Twain's Connection
There are claims that the famous writer of Huckleberry Finn, Mark Twain, invented his own version of the Memory Game. However, the details and nature of his version appear to be more like a playful way of figuring out taxes rather than matching cards. This modern Memory Game project does not have any direct connection to Mark Twain's version but serves as a nostalgic nod to the classic card-matching concept.

## Project Dependencies
The Memory Game project has been developed using the following technologies:
- HTML: For structuring the game board and layout.
